    question: `
      What are the benefits
    `,
    answer: `
      Cognitive Benefits: Music stimulates Emotional Benefits: Music is a beneficial tool to aid children from babies to teenagers in a developmental standpoint. 
      The usage of music  “provides and provokes many different responses in the human brain” and leads to “marked changes in emotions and movement” according to Trimble and Hesdorffer, 
      from the National LIbrary of Medicine, 2017. 
      Emotional management is an important aspect to proper development. 
      When children are able to control their impulses, they will be better equipped to handle many situations in life. 
      Listening to music stimulates our emotions and encourages self expression and focus as well as with self awareness and regulation. 
      Young children are able to identify emotions, reactions and the ways in which those emotions control reactions. 
      It aids children to adapt and learn the appropriate behaviors in different situations.
