            Music builds mental acuity in children and helps children build an
            understanding of how to process, identify, navigate, and express
            emotions leading to healthy informed choices.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a child is able to understand the emotions they feel they are
            less likely to act out, feel misunderstood, which can lead to a
            plethora of unwanted behaviors from drug use to chronic depression.
            With music based learning, a child is taught the right, kind, and
            productive way to navigate their feelings and in turn the best way
            to understand othersâ€™ as well.{" "}
